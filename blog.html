        <h2 id="first">How I Improved My CSS Skills</h2>
        <h6>February 6, 2021</h6>
        
        <p class="info">Swo years ago, I had just gotten employed at my job and we were going through an in between projects and contacts phase. Basically, as a developer, I was bored. 
            I didn't want to waste my time, so I decided to improve my CSS skills. Back then CSS for me was what I couldn't do with Bootstrap. It was just simple properties I added here and there. So, I decided I'd up my game by looking up challenges online.</p>

        <h2 id="second">I released my first book: How to use const in C++</h2>
        <h6>January 20, 2021</h6>
        
        <p class="info">In the book, I discuss the idea of constness which is so important that in certain languages entities are const, in other words, immutable by default. If you want to become a seasoned C++ developer, you must understand how you can use const correctly. In this book, you'll learn when and how to use it in the different contexts it might appear:

const functions
const local variables
const member variables
const return types
const parameters
Compared to the series of articles, the book contains extra code examples, more explanations and also the differences between const west and east const - without starting a holy war on different coding styles.</p>
